This repository is for working with the Cisco OpenVuln API.  The intent is to pull down all Cisco PSIRT advisories since a defined date (currently using 2013-01-01) until present.  This data is pulled down as a JSON file.   The raw JSON data is then written into a CSV for easy dissemination to teammates.
